# About
This is a simple blog application built with ruby on rails. It's based on a [tutorial by Traversy media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPy0GQJLZUM)

# Getting Started
Run the following command to start the server:
`rails s`
Then visit http://localhost:3000/ to see the app and add/edit/delete posts and comments.

# Test Driven Development
This project uses Rspec and Capybara for testing. To run a single test, run the following command:
`rspec spec/features/user_visists_homepage_spec.rb`
Replace the path with the path to any spec.rb file.
To run all tests, use the following command:
`rake`
